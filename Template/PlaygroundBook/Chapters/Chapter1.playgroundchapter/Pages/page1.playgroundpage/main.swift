 # Learning
 Besides Portuguese, Brazil has a second official language. It's called _Libras_ and means Brazilian sign language. However, the number of people that are able to communicate by it is really small. **The language is not normally taught in schools**.
 
 _Libras_ uses a lot of gestures, facial and corporeal expressions to communicate. Here on this playground, the idea is to **teach the alphabet, which uses only the hand**.

 It is important to highlight that **the alphabet is not the sign language itself, but a essencial part of it.** The letter signs are used as basis to many word signs, and are also used to spell people's and places' names.
 
 On this page, you will have a keyboard where you can **choose letters to see their hand gestures** according to the Libras alphabet.
 > If you clicked a key by mistake or just don't want to see its whole animation, click the "Stop" key.
