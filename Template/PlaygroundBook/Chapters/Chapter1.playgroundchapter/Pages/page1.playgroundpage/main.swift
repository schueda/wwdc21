 # Learning
 Besides Portuguese, Brazil has a second official language. It's called _Libras_ and means Brazilian sign language. However, the number of people that are able to communicate by it is really small. **The language is not normally taught in schools**.
 
 _Libras_ uses a lot of gestures, facial and corporeal expressions to communicate. Here on this playground, the idea is to **teach the alphabet, which uses only the hand**.

 It is important to highlight that **the alphabet is not the signal language itself, but a essencial part of it.** The letter gestures are used as basis to many word gestures, and are also used to spell people's and places' names. It is also one of the first things taught when teaching the Brazilian signal language.
 
 On this page, you will have a keyboard where you can **choose letters to see their hand gestures** according to the Libras alphabet.
 > If you clicked a key by mistake or just don't want to see its whole animation, click the "Stop" key.
